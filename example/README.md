# Sweep Usage Example

Currently sweep only transforms tempalte to PHP, so typical usage may involve:

1. write template according to sweep syntax
2. translate template to PHP
3. use the generated PHP to output final content

In this directory there is an example template and usage PHP.

Run `./walkthrough.sh` to see the final output, `output.html`.
